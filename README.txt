only a handful of these are to be read with a strong cup of coffee (I prefer mine with ice - that's from living in a hot climate).

in general I feel math has gotten way too sophisticated. and obscures its own progress through bad writing and other communication failures on math side. but also an innumerate public - there is a 1% who knows this stuff very well and a 99% which knows or uses barely none of tools available 

this blog ( this branch ) is geared towards that 0.01% of people who specialize in mathematical subjects.
