i remember things and once in a while i scribble them down (type them).  it's pretty desperate actually.  thanks for reading.

only a handful of these are to be read with a strong cup of coffee (I prefer mine with ice - that's from living in a hot climate).

in general I feel math has gotten way too sophisticated. and obscures its own progress through bad writing and other communication failures on math side. but also an innumerate public - there is a 1% who knows this stuff very well and a 99% which knows or uses barely none of tools available 

this blog ( this branch ) is geared towards people who specialize in mathematical subjects. 

here is an article I like http://mathoverflow.net/questions/167951/entropy-proof-of-brunn-minkowski-inequality

Sometimes I can see a lot, other times I see absolutely nothing.  And it's quite lonely because mostly everybody is waiting for a result.  Part of it is that math is really disconnected from the real world.  Many people ask me for the applications of math -- tha this called "Engineering"; and they will not indulge in the silly luxurious calculations such as here.  Instad as soon as its built we move on to the next project.  I think that is less exciting.

But time is money.  T = $

I find LaTeX to be constraining at times because it lacks the vivid nature of handwriting.  I thought it would be necessary to resort to TeX but people are showing me I can still achieve many new 
what do I work on ?
* I like the equation 1+2+3+...= -1/12 this is one of my favorite *
* I like Stirling formula. log 1 + log 2 + ... + log n = n log n - n + O(n)
* I would like to understand the mean value theorem f(a)-f(b)= (a-b)f'(c)
* if p(x) has all real roots then p'(x) roots interlace with those of p(x)
* any sequence of 21 distinct integers has an increasing subsequence of 6 or a decreasing sequence of 5

these formulas are pretty basic. but we can't do any better than dress these few gorillas or combine them. and no matter how smart we get never get past the basic dilemmas. 

there are some old books that I like 
Euclid's Elements , Fricke Klein, Principia  (Newton)

I think it's important to have your own point of view. for example Hardy and Wright introduction to number written without computer but now we have big data.  There are prime numbers larger than can be stored on computer. Is there anything we can do? Yet this is also our source of richness and complexity. 

the prime number theory is not only about density of primes. it can be about whether square free numbers have odd or even number of factors. or how quickly or evenly  fractions  of small denominator distribute on the number line. there is a lot to say about fractions and our system of random. we don't have the time or resources to tell the whole story. so we estimate or lie.

the modern   scientific literature moves very fast. and is developed by disconnected networks. so it's quite possible the same I act is defined in several different contexts. and math is a pretty fastidious subject asking for details that nobody cares about.how do we motivate such details? 

then I tell you the quick version and you get mad.   I spend a lot of energy parsing symbols and definitions. and never quite get to my objective.

Here are some conjectures:

a^4 + 2 obtains infinitely many square-free values
the AGT conjecture
the Birch-Tate conjecture
Every multiple-zeta value is spanned by zeta(n1,n2,...,nk) with nk in {2,3}
