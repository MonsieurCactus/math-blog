\noindent \textbf{9/20} Why do we need Riemann integration or even Lebesgue integration.  Here's an integral formula:
$$ \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}$$
In calculus class we just memorize a rule: $\int: x^n \to \frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}$ and apply the formula.  Here's one more:
$$ \int_0^{x} \cos x \, dx = \sin x $$
So there is a second rule $\int: \cos x \mapsto \sin x$. Once we buy into these one or two or a dozen rules, we can corner ourselves very quickly.  \textbf{Ex}: Show that 
$$ \int_0^{2\pi} f(x) \, \big( \sin Nx \big)^2 \, dx \to \pi f(x) $$
The formula looks right, we have that $0 < \sin^2 x < 1$ and it oscillates fairly evenly so the average should be $\frac{1}{2}$. \\ \\
Riemann integration was already a formality, Lebesgue integration was an even bigger formality. Here's a common-sense looking theorem that requires Lebesgue integration. \\ \\
\textbf{Problem}: Exchange integration and summation.  Let $f_k$ be a sequence of $L^1$ integrable functions such that $\sum_1^\infty |f_j| < \infty$.  Then $\sum f_k$ converges (almost everywhere) to a function in $L^1$ and 
$$ \int \sum_{i=1}^\infty f_k (x) \, dx = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \int f_k (x) \, dx $$
If the function sequences look forbidding, let $f_n(x) = a_n \, \sin n x$ with $0 \leq x \leq 1$. We want to know if
$$ \int \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_n \, \sin (2\pi n x) \, dx = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{a_n}{n} \, \cos(2\pi n x)  $$
There's even an easy choice $a_n = \frac{1}{\pi \, k}$. We obtain the sawtooth wave:
$$  \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{\sin 2\pi m x}{\pi k } = \frac{1}{2} - \{ x\} $$
It's the only one we ever study.  Despite it's usefulness in music, I'm mostly concered about it's arithmetic and geometric properties.  This ``=" sign is really shaky too.  At $x = \pi$ 
$$  \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{0 \pm \epsilon }{\pi k } \approx 0 \pm \left(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon \right) $$
Fortunately for us, nature (and certainly Mathemtical Physics) will offer us examples of natural processes that require Lebesgue theory to understand.

\noindent \textbf{Problem}  When do limits and integrals converge?
$$ \int f \, d\mu= \lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n  \, d\mu $$
If we look on the previous page of the Lebesgue theory textbook, we get conditions when this common-sense formula might work:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f_n$ is a sequence of $L^1$ functins (Lebesgue integrable)\footnote{Did we ever compute a Lebesgue integral in our lives?  So why we bother talking about Lebesgue integrable} with $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere.
\item There's a (non-negative) function $g \geq 0$ such that $|f_n| \leq g$ (almost everywhere).
\end{itemize}
Certainly the authors of these textbooks have lost their minds, and they are writing such a textbook for their health. \\ \\
\textbf{Thm} with these conditions, the limit $f \in L^1$ and $\int f = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n$. \\ \\
If we ever want this common-sense result to whole we need to more results from Lebesgue integration theory:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dominated Convergence Theorem
\item Fatou's Lemma
\item Monotone Convergence Theorem
\end{itemize}
Lebesgue measure is impossible to construct.  Half of probability (e.g. the Law of Large Numbers) is showing that a measure either converges to Lebesgue measure or to a point (or to a Gaussian centered at that point). \\ \\
\textbf{Example} Here's a set that requires measure theory to even try to estimate the size of.  Let $\alpha = \sqrt[4]{2}$ and consider the set $\{ (m,n) : 0 < m^2 + \sqrt[4]{2} \, n^2 < X \} $.  Here is a measure we could study:
$$ \mu(x) = \sum 1_{m^2 + \sqrt[4]{2}\,
n^2}(x) $$
There were two possible ways to write this set.  Any major differences?
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{ m^2 + \sqrt[4]{2}\,n^2 : 0 \leq m,n \leq N \}$
\item $\{ m^2 + \sqrt[4]{2}\,n^2 : 0 \leq m \leq M \; 0 \leq n \leq N \}$
\item $\{ (m,n) : 0 < m^2 + \sqrt[4]{2} \, n^2 < X \} $
\end{itemize}
The last set is a collection of pairs of integers (coordinates) and the first two sets are collections of real numbers. \\ \\
Here's a function we might study with Lebesgue theory:
$$ f(x) = \big| \{ (m,n) : 0 < m^2 + \sqrt[4]{2} \, n^2 < X \} \big| - \frac{\pi}{4\sqrt[4]{2}} X \approx 0$$
we've used nothing but familiar household objects and the equations describe a natural thing.
