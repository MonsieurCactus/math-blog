\noindent These gentlemen start off with a nice \textit{classical} analysis of the Bessel funtion.  These were surprising to me, but the formulas are quite old.
$$ Z(g) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} dx \, e^{- \frac{1}{2g} (\sin x)^2} 
= \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{g}} e^{-\frac{1}{4g}} I_0(\frac{1}{4g})$$
These formulas are related to the \textit{asymptotic expansion} of the Bessel funtion, but they can also considered a 0+0 dimensional quantum field theory. Later we have another variant of this expansion:
$$ Z(\xi) = \sqrt{\xi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}e^{-2\xi (\sin \phi)^2} d\phi 
= \int_{\mathcal{C}} \frac{e^{-\xi x}}{\sqrt{(1+x)(1-x)}}\, dx$$
We can show, using \textbf{variation of paramters} of some kind or another that $Z$ solves the Bessel differential equation:
$$ Z_*(\xi) = A \, I_0(\xi) + B \, K_0 (\xi)$$
This was revolutionary to me, but involves Riemann surface geomtry already discussed in the 19th century.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Do professors still study such integrals?
\item How is this different from ``asymptotic series"?  What is wrong with these formulas?
\item Is there a 0+1 dimensional quantum field theory? Where did these equations fit?
\end{itemize}
One hint we have is the next integral these gentelemen compute, curresponding to an elliptic curve:
$$ Z(\zeta, \xi) = \int \frac{e^{-x\xi}}{\sqrt{x(1 - (1 - \zeta)x)(1 + \zeta x)}} \, dx$$
These functions are still very versatile and could become a number of things.  And as they get more and more complex, we have theories about them, but their specific properties are less and less well-known. \\ \\
The asymptotic series is just the Taylor-expansion around $g = 0$.   If $|g| \ll 1$ we have this formula:
$$ Z(g) \stackrel{?}{\simeq} \sqrt{2\pi} \left[ 1 + \frac{g}{2} + \frac{9}{8}g^2 + \dots \right]$$
except we're now concerned this formula is no longer true for $g \notin \mathbb{R}$.  We could hashtag this \texttt{[sequences-and-series]} and consult our freshman analysis textbooks.  And a world of complications will unfold\dots
