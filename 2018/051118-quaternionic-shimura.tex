\maketitle

\noindent We are going to try to parse whatever we can in one of the latest editions of Advances in Mathematics.  My theory is that a lot of these papers at least start off about things we are familiar with.  Too much symbolic manipulation makes me a bit critical that we've lost track. 
\begin{quotation}
The aim of this paper is to compare arithmetic intersection numbers on Shimura varieties attached to inner forms of $\text{GL}_2$ over a real quadratic field $F$. \\ \\
To illustrate our approach, first consider the arithmetic volume of a Shimura variety attached to an inner form of $\text{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. \\ \\ 
\dots \\\\
We begin with a division quaternion algebra $B$ over $F$  whose discriminant $D_B := (p_1,\dots,p_r)\cdot\mathcal{O}_F$ is a non-empty product of split rational primes.
\end{quotation}
While I may be grossly underestimating the difficulty of such a task, I feel there should be instances where the problem is easy to state and describe.  Even if solving is a ton of work.\footnote{Then I have a job.} Even when they solve it, they understate the meaning so much it's just totally lost.\\ \\
