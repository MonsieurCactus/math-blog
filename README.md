this is my page for [Art of Problem Solving](http://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c13_contests) -- contest problems I find interesting but also keeping an eye towards modern topics.

to over-emphasize contest problems is kind of to miss the point -- these problems always represent opportunities to turn something quite tedious or dull and make it quite interesting!
