\noindent So if you have an average to compute, you might try to find a dynmical system and function (an ``observable") decide that it's ergodic, measure-preserving etc and show that the averages line up. \\ \\
Often our limiting measure could be something very simple, like $(\mathbb{R}, dx)$ or $(S^1, d\theta)$ (the angles of a circle). Or we infer our answer from these simple answer (this is why we do integrals). \\ \\
This is an example of an \textbf{interval exchange transformation}. 
$$ T(x) = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{c|c} 
x + (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}) & 0 < x < \sqrt{2}\quad \; \; \, \\
x + (\sqrt{5} - \sqrt{3}) & \sqrt{2} < x < \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\\
x - (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) & \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5} \end{array} \right. $$
Here is the graph of the function $x \mapsto T^{1000}(x)$. In fact, we need to be more specific we only sampled on a discrete set of points, $10^{-5}\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and we .  After a million points, we are testing the limits of my laptop computer or at least I have to make an explicit request to my computer, here using {\color{yellow!50!black}\texttt{Python 3}}.{\color{yellow!50!black}\texttt{6}}.{\color{yellow!50!black}\texttt{9}} \\

We can guess from the picture what the limiting measure $\mu$ might be.

\noindent The statements of the mean ergodic theorem (there's also a point-wise ergodic theorem) could be important or helpful. A measure-preserving system $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu, T) $ is ergodic if and only iff 
$$ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^\infty f \circ T^n \longrightarrow_{L^2_\mu} \int f \, d\mu $$
Here's another systement $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu, T)$ is ergodic if and only if 
$$ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \langle f \circ T^n, g \rangle \to \int f \, d\mu \int g \, d\mu $$
for any $f, g \in L^2_\mu$.  The book says we can optionally use set-theory that $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu , T)$ is ergodic if 
$$ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \mu (A \cap T^{-n} B) \to \mu(A) \mu(B) $$
these aveages are multiplicative \textit{in the limit}.  The definition of {\color{green!80!black}\textbf{mixing}} looks similar.
$$ \mu (A \cap T^{-n} B) \to \mu(A) \mu(B) $$
The \textbf{pre-images} are getting more and more shuffled until they are perfectly mixed \dots as mixed as they're ever going to get.  In fact, a (measure-preserving) dynamical system \\ \\
Two very innocent-looking culprits:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{shape}
\item \textbf{area} (or ``volume" or ``measure")
\end{itemize}
If we try to balance things on a ``scale" what did we mean by that.  What were we measuring or counting?
