Fermat showed that just like $5 = 2^2 + 1^2 $ and $41 = 4^2 + 5^2$ prime number can be written as the sum of two squares $$p = a^2 + b^2$$ for any prime number $p = 4k+1$.  The first few are easy to compute by hand, but try to write:

$$ p = 817,504,253 = a^2 + b^2 \tag{$\ast$}$$

where $x$ and $y$ are integers.  When you are done with that look at the [Prime Pages](http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/millions/) or feel free to generate your own list.

There are a few proofs in Hardy and Wright's [An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers](.) Here is one:

> If $p = 4k+1$ then $(\frac{p-1}{2})!^2 = -1 \mod p$ this is connected to WilsoÅ„ s theorem and Fermat's little theorem.  At least we know $x^2 = -1 \mod p$ has a solution, $x = \sqrt{-1} \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.  
> <br><br>
> Then consider the lattice generated by $(x,1), (p,0) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$.  The area of the fundamental domain is $p$.  The circle $x^2 + y^2 = p$ has area $\pi p > p$, so there is a point of this lattice inside the circle.  
> <br><br>
> The lattice point $(a,b)\neq (0,0)$ closest to the origin inside of this circle must lie exactly on the circle, so $a^2 + b^2 = p$.

While, after reading this I still have no idea how to find $(a,b)$ technically this is still a proof. 

Don Zagier published a 1-sentence proof using an involution on the set 
$\\{(x,y,z): x^2 + 4yz = p \\} $ [[1](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/31113/zagiers-one-sentence-proof-of-fermats-theorem), [2](http://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/zagier/files/doi/10.2307/2323918/fulltext.pdf)]  
It is a run-on sentence simplifying work of Heath-Brown  [[3](http://eprints.maths.ox.ac.uk/677/1/invariant.pdf)] 
The style is so different, maybe we can treat it separately.
