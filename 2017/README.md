As you can see I am handwriting things for a bit, in order to move things a bit quickly.  These eventually **must** be typed,
which is going to pose special challenges.

In all of these I am trying my luck.  There are a lot of smart people proving exicing results every day.

* In many cases, the result is stated as an abstract theory and I would like a specific case
* Occassionally, there is an explicit open problem to be solved
* Sometimes a "new" result seems to match up with a result buried in an old textbook, no longer in use
* Sometimes the same concept runs under several different names (or in the other way, the same concept name is over used)
* Typically the existing proof is very, very complicated and I am asking for an easier way -- "Life Hacks"

And I am always pushing it.
You know what? I have no plans to finish my PhD. **You** can decide what is know or publishable and what isn't.
