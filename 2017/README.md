To me arXiv is like *telenovela* it's like the soap operas.  This happens and
that happens.  Never comes to any real conclusion.  We can't stop watching.

Every day a few nice papers surface on arXiv.  However, doing research is not
like reading the newspaper.  If I pick one or two
interesting articles every day, and other articles to support them, that turns
into a few thousand pages of reading every month.  In the past, we thought
things through a little bit more because there was less to go around.

Information overload is not a bad thing -- it's a sign of the times.  A huge
turning point was downloading papers to my phone and reading them on very long
bus rides in San Juan.  It really wasn't anyone's business that I was an
academic, and they may be better off not knowing.

What the smart-phone revolution hasn't solved is the need for scratch-work and
for paper.  

As for math, generating half-way convincing projects is a bit of a dark art.
There's a lot of good starting points in the other
[readme](README-01.md), it took years to develop judgment and an ear.  One
challenge this semester is audience.  I can pitch the topics very high to
other professors or I can try to reach everybody.  

For me school has always been an issue.  Is school relevant or is it just
busy-work the teachers force you to do.  A lot of advanced theories amount to
fluff.  If you look in the middle of the article, there's always a bunch of
integrals or algebra or geometry or whatever, organized in different ways.

Communications is a good issue.  YouTube has become even more feasible than ever.
I've been saying this for the good part of more than a year.

A lot of these notes are either

* plot summary
* me getting stuck on a technical issue
* me finding the concept written several times in different places

it could be I am not formatting my work in a goal-oriented way: here is a problem
and here is the solution. Usually when I do that, people start shooting the breeze.
At the pace of about two notes every two weeks, I can put my finger into the
literature current, but still keep it moving.  They're almost like real articles
at this point I'm somewhat pleased.
