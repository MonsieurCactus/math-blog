As you can see I am handwriting things for a bit, in order to move things a bit quickly.  These eventually **must** be typed,
which is going to pose special challenges.

In all of these I am trying my luck.  There are a lot of smart people proving exicing results every day.

* In many cases, the result is stated as an abstract theory and I would like a specific case
* Occassionally, there is an explicit open problem to be solved
* Sometimes a "new" result seems to match up with a result buried in an old textbook, no longer in use
* Sometimes the same concept runs under several different names (or in the other way, the same concept name is over used)
* Typically the existing proof is very, very complicated and I am asking for an easier way -- "Life Hacks"

And I am always pushing it.
You know what? I have no plans to finish my PhD. **You** can decide what is know or publishable and what isn't.

There are lots of really great videos on the internet ranging from the very basic to the professional level.  This blog, in particular is always teaching to the very front of the class.  
If you're having trouble following, so am I.

There are lots of excellent videos now.  Lots of ways to keep our fingers moving in a healthy and meaningful way. It was not always like this!!

These videos are chosen because of catchy titles and b/c of a vague sense of "I should learn this."   I mean why do I choose the problms so basic?  After talking to lots of people, I've decided there can't be too many ideas or too many that is very deep.

* everybody is in a hurry
* nobody has time
* nobody reads closely
* nobody writes carefully

So... there will be a lot of gaps! As you have guessed all the sum-of-squares and factorial stuff could get binned into two big conjectures: **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer** and **abc-conjecture**.  These are still not-quite-right.  And all these videos drag on and on and could benefit from lessons on Storytelling.

Math lectures are God-awful.  Usually I get a New York Times crossword puzzle and fill it out while the man or woman is talking.  Just terrible.

It grieves me to learn that mathematician [Jean-Christophe Yoccoz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Christophe_Yoccoz) is dead.  I have never met the guy, but it as always been on my to-do list to learn about [interval-exchange transformations](https://www.college-de-france.fr/media/jean-christophe-yoccoz/UPL15305_PisaLecturesJCY2007.pdf) and square-tiled surfaces more carefully.  And then I would go to Paris and sip a glass of champaigne and write equations.  Feasibility is another story.

I remember watching the [TV](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/jean-christophe-yoccoz/course-2016-02-03-10h00.htm) show (his lectures rather difficult), and mid-way through the series he passes away; he croaks.  And then I said: now what?
