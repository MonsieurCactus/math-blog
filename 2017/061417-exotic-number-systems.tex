\noindent Something truly exotic challenges your norms a little bit\dots makes one feel uneasy. \\ \\
The goal of this project is to study new numbers and number-like things.  We only try a small fraction of the ideas available. And there's no guarantee this will work. \\ \\
Our decimal system is intimately related to the multiplication by ten shift map $\times 10$ we can envision a number as a sequence of decimal digits (kind of like a factory)
$$ \pi = 3. \to  1 \to 4 \to 1 \to 5 \to 9 \to \dots $$
Each digit is connected to the last by one either by multplying by ten or shifting by 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item $T: x \mapsto (10 \times x ) \pmod 1 $  with  $x \in \mathbb{R}$\\ 
\item $T: (x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots ) \mapsto (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots ) $ with $x \in \{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$
\end{itemize}
This framework kind of forgets that $\mathbb{R}$ is a ring $(\mathbb{R}, + , \times)$ or even a group $(\mathbb{R}, +)$.  Regardless of our choice of $T$ we can say that rings are isomorphic. Yet, in reality we must make a choice of $T$, and it can have nothing to do with the decimal system.
$$ (x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots ) \oplus (y_0, y_1, y_2, \dots ) = \;? $$
Our goal is to explain the different ways $\mathbb{R}$ could be partitioned and try to achieve an analogue of addition with carries.  Some partitions are more ordinary, others are more unique. 

\newpage

\noindent \textbf{6/15} I have a lot on my mind.  I saw a discussion on the internet that made me re-think all the proofs I could think of about the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$.  Wikipedia suggested that descent proofs like this one:
$$ p^2 = 2q^2 \to p \equiv 0 \pmod 2 \to p = 2r \to (2r)^2 = 2q^2 \to q^2 = 2r^2  $$
are examples of Galois cohomology.  Is that true? Textbooks other than Wikipedia use another example:
$$ p = a^2 + b^2 \quad\text{ iff}\quad p = 4k+1 $$
Unfortunately, none of these textbooks explain how to simplify the machinery or to build it from scratch.   I even went as far as to ask the very authors of the textbooks themselves, and they didn't know, they didn't care; they have bigger fish to fry. \\ \\
They really do.  I do not.  \\ \\
This is how I learn and teach: agonizing over the basics attaching names to everything. Their theory is failing my textcase, and these days I'd rather believe my own experience than 100 experts.\\ \\
Intermediate between elementary number theory.  Is the theory of \textbf{heights}.  On the set of pairs fractions or pairs of integers we could assign a number:
$$ \bigg[ \frac{p}{q} \in \mathbb{Q} \bigg] \leftrightarrow  \bigg[ [p:q] \in \mathbb{Q}P^1 \bigg] \mapsto |p|+|q| \in \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R} $$
The map $(p,q) \mapsto (q,r)$ leads to an infinite decreasing sequence of heights with values in $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ which is impossible.  \\ \\
Then we find out height are related to \textbf{torsors} which are then related to a cohomology of some kind.  I am scared there will be other examples of instances of heights that are not so trivial, and I will be unable. \\ \\
There are textbooks on Galois Cohomology written by smart guys like JP Serre who give outlines, but in a way we're on our own.  Even the cohomology theory we could build ourselves. \\ \\
Why such a complicated thing?  I could total envision an arithmetic where our fractions:
$$ \bigg[ \frac{p}{q} \in \mathbb{Q} \bigg] $$
Our replaced with some other complicated figment of our imagination, which may also prove to be a useful arithemtic concept.  Our goal is to solve the equation:
$$  \bigg\{  x^2 - 2y^2 = 0 \bigg\} \stackrel{?}{=} [\varnothing ]\subseteq \mathbb{Q}^2  $$
How can this equation be nothing it is the union of two lines.  Clearly I can re-write this as:
$$ x^2 - 2y^2 = (x-\sqrt{2}y) ( x + \sqrt{2}y) = 0 \text{ therefore } \Big[ x-\sqrt{2}y = 0\Big] \text{ or }
\Big[ x+\sqrt{2}y = 0 \Big] $$
Is this OK?  And if not, there are 28 other proofs I can find on the internet\footnote{\texttt{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/sq\_{}root.shtml}}
