\noindent Terence Tao sees a lot of things, but he writes in an obfuscated way, and I think he misses a lot of things.  About 10 years ago, I was introduced to the topic of \textbf{nilsequences} in a course of Dynamics and Number Theory.  I did nothing with it.  Let's read Terry's latest blog on this topic\footnote{\texttt{https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2017/04/28/notes-on-nilcharacters-and-their-symbols/}}. \\ \\
Part of it is like\dots where do fractions come from?  \\ \\
If we take scientific measurement, there's quite a bit error that obstructs us from observing the most delicate patterns.  In fact, shielding us completely from finding them (or protecting us). \\ \\
$\sqrt{2} = 1.414213562373095048801688724209698078
5696718753769480731766797379907324784621070388503 $ \\ \\
If you examine the digits carefully\footnote{\texttt{http://www.gutenberg.org/files/129/129.txt}} we can prove the decimals do not exhibit any pattern in the decimal expension.  However, if we use continued fractions: \\ \\
$\sqrt{2} = [1; 2,2,2,2,2 , \dots ] $
and this is a nicer system since we have exponential convergence of the the number.  Here the error is $10^{-6}$ (microscopic). \\ \\

\end{tikzpicture} \\
These pictures lead to two different proofs that $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$.  They are both geometric proofs, and argue by infinite descent.  Therefore, there must have been an \`{e}tale cohomology. \\ \\
I have no idea what \`{e}tale cohomology and the books do not simplify it enough for me. \\ 
Forget it.  One way to get meaningful numbers to arbitrary accuracy is to observe a dynamical system over time and take detailed measurements.  And you will see.
