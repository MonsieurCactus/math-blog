\maketitle

\noindent I'd like to do a chops piece.  There is a lot of discussion of entanglement entropy and it's written in foreign language.  We just choose a point of contact and try it:
$$ \langle \langle S | q^{\sum_{i=1}^N (L^i_0 + \overline{L}^i_0 - \frac{1}{12} ) }   | S \rangle \rangle = g^2 \, \Theta_\Lambda (2it) \, \big[\eta(2it) \big]^{-N} $$
I don't know why they wrote a thing, or the meaning of certain symbols such as $| S \rangle\rangle$.   I have seen the symbol $L_0$ but I don't know quite what it's doing here.  $\Theta$ functions are very common place in math, but they are not the only modular forms in existence. \\ \\
It's very very difficult to say what these people are writing about.  I write a similar proposal before and never did anything with it. \\ \\
This is \textbf{Conformal Field Theory}.  Depending on who you ask, it is on solid or shaky foundation. We have this other buzzword that we like {\color{red!50!yellow!50!green}\textbf{Entanglement Entropy}}. \\ \\
Let's say it one more time, ``Entanglement Entropy".  Feels good, don't it?
