There are a number of textbooks I wanted to work though.  I think that doing 
exercises is the only way you can truly learn.  There's small dilemma, that I could
be skewing classes if I post my solutions online.  I don't think there is that
risk because if you're smart enough to read these textbooks you really don't 
want to use my answers in your problem sets.

* Additive Combinatorics (Tao + Vu)
* Lectures on K-theoretic computations in enumerative geometry (Okounkov)
* 3264 and All That (Joe Harris + David Eisenbud)
* [N=2 Supersymmetric Dynamics for Pedestrians](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2684) (Yuji Tachikawa) 
* [ESL](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) Elements of Statistical Learning 
* [ISL](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) 
* (many others)

These are textbooks that are written with students in mind.  All the time
I wonder why these equations are always getting so technical, because in the end
we don't waste a lot of time if the instructions are too complicated.  Yet
we want goods and results of best quality.  How can we have it both ways?
