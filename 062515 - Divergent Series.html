Trying understand the spectral theorem.  We have some compact operator $A$ acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, then it has eigenvalues 
$\\{ \lambda\_i \\}\_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} $ and eigenvectors $\\{ |\phi\_i \rangle\\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} $.  Then using the spectral theorem I am inclined to write:

$$ A = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \lambda_n |\phi _n \rangle \langle \phi_n | $$

A simple choice could be the Laplacian, let $\mathcal{H} = L^2 (S^1)$ and $A = \frac{d^2}{d\theta^2}$,  then $\lambda_n = n^2$ and $\langle \theta | \phi_n \rangle = e^{in\theta}$.

$$ \frac{d^2}{d\theta^2} 
=   \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} n^2 | \phi_n \rangle  \langle \phi_n |  $$

There is something horribly wrong with this, because in fact my choice of $A$ is not-compact and $n^2 \not \to 0$.

If we can Fourier expand the dirac delta function using the theory of distributions can we also Fourier expand the derivative?

$$ \delta''(\theta) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} n^2 e^{in\theta}$$

The meaning of the Dirac delta is somewhat delicate, but we can still plot, here $|n| < 10$.

Although this was intended to be a discussion of the zeta function, we have generated an evaluated a number of interesting zeta functions.  I believe we have the equality as operators on the Hilbert Space $L^2 (S^1)$

$$ \int\_0^\theta d\theta_1\, \int\_0^{\theta\_1} d\theta\_2 =   \sum\_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} n^{-2} | \phi\_n \rangle  \langle \phi\_n |  $$

Unfortunately, I don't know how to avoid using dummy variables for iterated integrals.  Then $\zeta(2)$ is the trace of this operator in some sense.

Lastly there is a Kernel $\mathsf{K}(\theta_1, \theta_2)$ which is supported on $0 < \theta_1 + \theta_2 < 2\pi$.  It's unclear to me why the square defined by this kernel defined by a polygon (using the convolution twist of multiplication, a cocyle), should encode as much information as the Laplacian.

What are the matrix elements of this kernel

$$ \langle n\_1 | \mathsf{K} | n\_2 \rangle = \int\_0^1 d\theta\_1 \int\_0^{\theta\_1} d\theta\_2 \; e^{2\pi i (n\_1 \theta_1 - n\_2 \theta\_2)} $$

Stephen Hawking probably knew all of this already.  Also some notes on spectral theory https://people.math.ethz.ch/~kowalski/spectral-theory.pdf
