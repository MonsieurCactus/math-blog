# Conformally Invariant 

New mathematical ideas are falling upon us every day.  Sometimes the same idea over and over...


### [16 Dec 2014]() - Cauchy Schwartz vs Pigeonhole

In light of some cryptic remarks on MathOverflow, we try to understand better why the Cauchy Schwartz inequality and the Pigeonhole Princple are two sides of the same coin.  Initially they look completely different.  How can

$$ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{1/2}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^{1/2} \geq ax + by + cz$$

be the same as painting 4 boxes with three colors, two of them being the same?

### [10 Dec 2014]() - Sangaku: Geometry of Circles 

I want to draw the Apollonian circle packing picture from Wikipedia, but 
I keep getting stuck on this problem about 4 circles.
