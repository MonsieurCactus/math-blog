\noindent $L^2$ spaces are somewhat natural because we have Pythagoras theorem:
$$  \big|\big| (a,b)\big|\big|^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$
I have trouble understanding the meaning of the $L^p$ norms:
$$   \big( a^p + b^p \big)^{1/p}$$
I have no interpretation for them.  There's no picture I can draw.  \\ \\
There are a few starting points. Let $p,q \in (1, \infty)$ be related by
$$ \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q}=1 $$
Then all measurable functions $f,g \geq 0$ satisfy:
$$ \int fg \, d\mu \leq \big|\big|f\big|\big|_p \, 
\big|\big|g\big|\big|_q $$
so for some reason this relationship of fractions gets promoted to a relationship of measurable functions. \\ \\
There is also Minkowski inequality:
$$ \big|\big| f + g \big|\big|_p \leq 
\big|\big| f  \big|\big|_p + 
\big|\big| g  \big|\big|_p $$
and it's downhill from there.  I have read in some places these have their origins in \textbf{convex gometry} in high dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^n$.  \\ \\
All the arguments I'm finding are pretty clumsy and not very geometric.  Instead we drown in a morass of
\begin{itemize}
\item poor disorganized writing
\item clumsy notation
\item non-visual thinking
\end{itemize}
I am concluding this subject is simply too difficult.  And going for my bike ride.
