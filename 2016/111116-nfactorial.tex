\maketitle

\noindent There are famous McMahon formulas and I could be mixing them up.  Here is one, which counts literally \textit{all} plane paritions:
$$ \sum_{\pi} q^{|\pi|} = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{1-q^n} \right)^n$$
My apology in advance for not having a good picture.  They are take some work to draw.  Here we take example from Mirjana Vuletic.

This is good but not really what I am looking for today.

\newpage

\noindent I am looking for those partitions which fit inside an $a \times b \times c$ box.  There is an exact number on Wikipedia:
$$ \# \{ boxes\} = \prod_{i=1}^a 
\prod_{j=1}^b
\prod_{k=1}^c \frac{i+j+k-1}{i+j+k-2}$$
and you might wonder why so much attention might be drawn to a simple equation like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inside Mathematics - literally thousands of papers and they keep coming
\item Outside Mathematics - maybe a statistician or data analyst might find this structure relates to something in the real world\footnote{Baseball, elections, the human genome, the weather, instagram, the radio... and the end of the day these are all tables of numbers and there exist procedures where these can processed in a similar ways.}
\end{itemize}
Today we will do something totally useless and set $a = b = c = \frac{1}{2}$.  How many ways to pack $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cubes into a box of side $\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ ? \\ \\
The procedure for guessing a value of $(\frac{1}{2})!$ might stem from Euler's definition of factorial:
$$ x! = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^x \, n!}{x \times (x+1)\times (x+2)\times \dots (x+n)} $$

\newpage

\noindent Let's try to shift the product lattice by $(x,y,z)$:
$$  
\prod_{i=1}^a 
\prod_{j=1}^b
\prod_{k=1}^c \frac{(i+j+k)+(x+y+z)-1}{(i+j+k)+(x+y+z)-2} $$
I don't even know what this number is.  OK.  Let
$$ n!! = 0! \times 1! \times \dots \times (n-1)! $$
and we can even define the $q$-factorial 
$$[n]_q! := \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1 -q^n}{1-q} $$
The hyperfactorial (and the Barnes G-function)
$$ \sum_\pi q^{|\pi|} = \frac{a!!_q b!!_q c!!_q (a+b+c)!!_q}{(a+b)!!_q (b+c)!!_q (c+a)!!_q} $$
and we can set $q=1$ to get one McMahon formula.  Or let $a,b,c \to \infty$ to get the other.\footnote{Everything fits together in McMahon world.  Everything is beautiful!} \\ \\
And now we can set $a = b = c = \frac{1}{2}$, so that $(\frac{1}{2})! = \sqrt{\pi}$ and $(\frac{1}{2})!! = \dots $ Euler never wrote a formula for the Barnes G-function. \\ \\
Oh my this got complicated.  Have an answer in a bit.
