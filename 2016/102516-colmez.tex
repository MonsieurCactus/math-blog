\maketitle

\noindent  I found this neat little formula on the internet:
$$ \frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{24})\Gamma(\frac{11}{24})}
{\Gamma(\frac{5}{24})\Gamma(\frac{7}{24})}
= \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}} $$
My question was answered by Noam Elkies\footnote{Fellow Stuyesant alumnus} using various cheap multiplication tricks, he derives th formula in question.  He explains to me a bit what I am looking at, and why some of these equations might be happening.\footnote{Equations like these are divorced from applications.  I go to an engineer's desk and read one equation on page of his notes - completely irrelevant to the application he has in mind - and run with it.}\\ \\
The core equation: \textbf{mirror formula} is really kind of the only formula there is for the Gamma function:
$$ \Gamma(z) \Gamma(1-z) = \frac{\pi}{\sin \pi z}$$
\newpage

\noindent Given the connection between the Gamma function and the factorial: $\Gamma(n+1)=n!$ we get a relation between the factorial and the sine.\footnote{De Moivre's formula $ e^{ix} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta $ is already quite exotic since it claims that exponentials and trigonometry are related.  More fudamentally:
$$ \textbf{size} \asymp \textbf{angle} $$ 
The relationship between factorial $n!$ and trig function $\sin \theta$ is a bit more exotic.} \\ \\
Here is one more:
$$ F( \tfrac{1}{4},\tfrac{1}{4};1;\tfrac{1}{64}) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{7\pi}} \times \left[\frac{ 
\Gamma(\frac{1}{7})\Gamma(\frac{2}{7})\Gamma(\frac{4}{7})
}{
\Gamma(\frac{3}{7})\Gamma(\frac{5}{7})\Gamma(\frac{6}{7})
}\right]^{1/2}$$
expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function.  I could not find an infinte product for general hypergeometric funtions, but there could be for special values.
$$F( \tfrac{1}{4},\tfrac{1}{4};1;\tfrac{1}{64})
= \frac{\Gamma(1)}{\Gamma(\frac{3}{4})\Gamma(\frac{1}{4})} \int_0^1  \frac{dz}{\sqrt[4]{z^3(1-z)(1-zx)}} $$
and $\Gamma(1) = 0! = 1!$ Just trying to make it look like binomial coefficients. \\ \\
In general there is something called \textbf{Chowla-Selberg} formula.  Legendre knew
$$ \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{dt}{1 - k^2 \sin^2 t}
= \frac{2^{2/3} 3^{1/4}}{8\pi})\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})^3 $$
where $k = \sin \frac{\pi}{12}$ and there is an Elliptic curve related to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$. \\ \\
And Elkies knew these special integrals are artifacts of possibly
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Colmez conjecture 
	\item  Abelian varieties or Shimura Varieties
	\item  Chowla-Selberg or Gross-Zagier formulas
	\item  Complex multiplication
	\item  Motives, Homology, etc
	\item  Andre-Oort conjecture
\end{itemize}
Unfortunately these are written in very complicated abstract language.   It is very likely that classical computations (with an $\int$-sign) could exhibit they phenomenon they are talking about. \\ \\
One shorthand they use is to say:
$$ \phi \in H^1 \longleftrightarrow \int_a^b  \in H^1   $$
I have written the correspondence in schematic and incorrect fashion.

\newpage

\noindent With zero knowledge of this field a few surprises already:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why is there no special Gamma function for numberfields $\Gamma_{\mathbb{Q}(i)}$, $\Gamma_\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$? etc.
\end{itemize}
At the heart is the first contour integral we always know:
$$  \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \tan^{-1} x \bigg|^\infty_{-\infty} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \bigg(-\frac{\pi}{2} \bigg) = \pi $$
There is lots of questions here.\footnote{ I just made up this formula I don't even remember -- I assume Cauchy residue formula is correct, without verifying the approximations made in the proof work.}  In between the lines this is a question about the curve:
$$ y^2 = x^2 + 1 $$
This is a hyperbola over real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, and is a \textbf{sphere} (genus 0) over $\mathbb{C}$. \\ \\ 
Here is the example from Colmez own paper.  Let $\epsilon = e^{i\pi/8}$ (this is an {\color{green!80!white}octogon})
$$ \int_\epsilon^{\epsilon^3} \frac{x^3 - x}{\sqrt{x^8 + 1}} \frac{dx}{x} = \frac{2\pi i}{8} (\epsilon^6 - \epsilon^2) \left( \frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2})}{
\Gamma(\frac{5}{8})\Gamma(\frac{7}{8})} \right)$$
Here it is instructive to draw the octogon where the poles should lie, and the line between two corners. 
\newpage

\noindent So what is this new-fangled language Math professors are talking about?  Here is a formula for a Faltings height:
$$ h_\text{Fal}( X_{y^2 = x^5 + 1})
= \log 2\pi - \frac{1}{2} \log \left(
\Gamma(\frac{1}{5})^5
\Gamma(\frac{2}{5})^3
\Gamma(\frac{3}{5})
\Gamma(\frac{1}{5})^{-1} \right) $$
Obviously this is an \textbf{entropy}.  Except I don't know what a Jacobian variety or a Faltings height.

\newpage

\noindent At least here are some of my own thoughts.  I might start by using Euler's formula for the factorial:
$$ \Gamma(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^x n!}{x(x+1)(x+2)\dots (x+n)} $$
so what could we mean by re-ordering half an object?
$$\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2}) = \lim_{n \to \infty}
\frac{ \sqrt{n} \;n!}{ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{5}{2} \times \dots \times \big(\frac{1}{2}+n\big)} $$
This number is related to the middle binomial coefficient.  We have that:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{5}{2} \times \dots \times \bigg( \frac{1}{2}+(n-1) \bigg)
= \frac{(2n)!}{2^n \, n!}
 $$
The DeMoivre-Laplace limit formula - for the middle binomial coefficient 
$$ \frac{(2n)!}{n! \times n!} =  \binom{2n}{n} \asymp
\; 2^{2n} \times \frac{1}{ \sqrt{\pi n}} $$
Somehow these stupid objects have to yield statements about Galois theory, L-functions, etc.
