\noindent  Conformal field theory is a central topic in mathematical physics\footnote{What does that even mean?  Here it means there are other math problems  in fields like Number Theory and Topology and Chern Simons Theory -- and specific sources -- which point to the paper we will review today. }.  What is Conformal Field Theory? \\
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.35]

The rational gaussian model has a single scalar free field $\phi$ which is compactified on a circle with $R^2 \in \mathbb{Q}$.  \\ \\
This theory has a large group of symmetries -- an extension of the the $U(1)$ current algebra. \\ \\
The $N$ primary fields $[\phi_p]$ are vertex-operators with momentum $\frac{p}{\sqrt{N}}$ and $p \in \mathbb{Z}_N$. \\ \\
The fusion rules are $\phi_p \times \phi_q = \phi_{p+q}$ with $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\newpage

\noindent The discussion the last page is already quite problematic.  Why is $R^2 \in \mathbb{Q}$ , e.g. $R = \sqrt{3}$? \\ \\
It seems I have confused $\phi$ and $\varphi$.  These are related by the exponential function:
$$ \phi_p ( \textbf{c} )
= \exp \left( \frac{p}{\sqrt{N}} 
\int_\textbf{c} \partial \varphi \right)$$
this is such a nice looking integrals with nice properties:
$$ 
\phi_p ( \textbf{a} )
\phi_q ( \textbf{b} )
= 
e^{ 2\pi i \, pq/N}
\phi_q ( \textbf{b} )
\phi_p ( \textbf{a} )
$$
Now I want to know why these feel like the basic commutation operators from Quantum Mechanics:
$$ [x, p] = -i \hbar $$
and you can even prove these yourself, right? Let $p = -i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}$ then:
$$ \left[ x, i\hbar \frac{d}{dx} \right]f(x)
= i\hbar \left( x \frac{df}{dx}  - 
x\frac{df}{dx} + \frac{dx}{dx}f\right) = -i\hbar $$
Expect we are getting the exponentiated form.  That's it\footnote{I am not going to review anything more from Verlinde's paper -- I will be too busy making sense of these objects to discuss anything else.}

\newpage

\noindent Excuse me, Verline talks about the $S$ and $T$ operators.  The first one is clear:
$$ S: \chi_p \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{q \in \mathbb{Z}_N} e^{2\pi i \, pq / N}\chi_q $$
The only $\textit{S}$ and $\textit{T}$ operators that I know very well act on a Torus:
$$ S: \begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[color= red, line width=5pt] (0,0)--(1,0);
\draw[color=blue, line width=5pt] (1,0)--(1,1);
\draw[color= red, line width=5pt] (1,1)--(0,1);
\draw[color=blue, line width=5pt] (0,1)--(0,0);
\end{tikzpicture} \to 
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[color= red, line width=5pt] (0,0)--(1,0);
\draw[color=blue, line width=5pt] (0,1) circle (1pt);
\draw[color= red, line width=5pt] (1,1)--(0,1);
\draw[color=blue, line width=5pt] (1,1)--(0,0);

\draw[dashed] (0,0)--(0,1);
\draw[dashed] (1,0)--(1,1);

\fill[color=blue] (0,1) circle (5pt);
\fill[color=blue] (1,0) circle (5pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
 $$
The other operator flips the torus (a technical term):
$$ T: \begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[color= red, line width=5pt] (0,0)--(1,0);
\draw[color=blue, line width=5pt] (1,0)--(1,1);
\draw[color= red, line width=5pt] (1,1)--(0,1);
\draw[color=blue, line width=5pt] (0,1)--(0,0);
\end{tikzpicture} \to 
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[color=blue, line width=5pt] (0,0)--(1,0);
\draw[color= red, line width=5pt] (1,0)--(1,1);
\draw[color=blue, line width=5pt] (1,1)--(0,1);
\draw[color= red, line width=5pt] (0,1)--(0,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
 $$
This action lifts to \textbf{observable} that happens on that torus.  
$$ T: \chi_p \to e^{2\pi i \, p /N}\chi_p $$
With some effort these can happen on an octagon\footnote{Perhaps I should draw these by hand first!}\\

\draw (1, -0.356)--(1  , 0.356);
\draw (1,  0.356)--(0.356,   1);

\draw (-0.356, 1)--(-1, 0.356);
\draw (-1, 0.356)--(-1,-0.356);
\draw (-1, -0.356)--(-0.356,-1);
\draw (-0.356, -1)--(0.356, -1);
\draw (0.356, -1)--(1, -0.356);
\end{tikzpicture}
...

\draw[dashed] (1,  0.356)--(0.356,   1);
\draw (0.356, 1) -- (-0.356, 1);
\draw[dashed] (-0.356, 1)--(-1, 0.356);
\draw (-1, 0.356)--(0.356,1);
\draw[dashed] (-1, 0.356)--(-1,-0.356);
\draw (-1, -0.356)--(1, 0.356);
\draw[dashed] (-1, -0.356)--(-0.356,-1);
\draw (-0.356, -1)--(0.356, -1);
\draw (-0.356, -1)--(1, -0.356);
\draw[dashed] (0.356, -1)--(1, -0.356);
\draw (-1, -0.356)--(0.356, 1);
\draw (-0.356,-1)--(1, 0.356);
\end{tikzpicture} \\
Verlinde's big result is: \textbf{the modular transformation $S$ diagonalizes the fusion rules}\footnote{See?  We can recite these formulas over and over many times with no idea what they mean :-)}
$$ \phi_p \times \phi_q = \phi_{p+q} $$

\newpage

\noindent How do we compactify the free scalar field on a circle?  \\ \\
Verlinde could have reminded us this scalar field was a section\footnote{or function} $\varphi: \mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z} + \tau \mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{R}$.  I think it's over $\mathbb{R}$.  It could be a complex valued field. \\ \\
Our torus is $S^1 \times S^1$ but I wish to remember the complex structure, so we remember\footnote{This space makes more sense after you've done a lot of cut-and-paste as on the previous page.} the number: $\tau \in \mathbb{C} / \text{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$  that section is generated by two transformations:
$$z \mapsto z + 1 \hspace{1in} z \mapsto - \frac{1}{z} $$
For that matter we could pick other very simple transformations and it makes a huge world of different.  For the record:
$$z \mapsto z + 1 \hspace{1in} z \mapsto - \frac{1}{4z} $$
That is because holomorphic function's don't just take partial derivatives.

It's hard to draw the picture of what holomorphic means... that the real and imaginary parts change in a compatible way.

\newpage

\noindent A \textbf{free field} or more specifically a \textbf{free boson} or \textbf{gaussian model} as an action:
$$ S = \int \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int \partial X \overline{\partial X} $$
and Ginsparg tells us the propagator should be:
$$ \langle X(z, \overline{z})\, X(w, \overline{w} )\rangle = - \frac{1}{2} \log |z - w| $$
What is a conformal field anyway?  Length behaves nicely under conformal mappings:
$$ ds^2 \mapsto \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right)
\bigg( \frac{\partial \overline{f}}{\partial \overline{z}} \bigg) ds^2 $$
This field splits into a holomorphic and anti-holomorphic part\footnote{they are not complex conjugates... $x$ depends on $z$ and $\overline{x}$ depends holomorphically on $\overline{z}$.  Nature somehow requires the real and imaginary parts to behave separate but equal -- in reality creating two different worlds.}
$$ X(z, \overline{z}) = \frac{1}{2}( x(z) + \overline{x}(\overline{z}) ) $$
and I can't seem to find how $X$ behaves under conformal mappings $z \mapsto f(z)$.

\newpage

\noindent Conformal fields seem to be \textbf{representations of the Virasoro algebra} describing things that transform nicely under conformal maps:
$$ \ell_n: z \mapsto z + \epsilon \, z^n $$
I am looking for a formula for $x(z)$.  Reading many many times I try a formula I saw elsewhere:
$$ x(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n z^n $$
where $a_n$ is either an\footnote{The first version -- which makes the most sense to me -- I learned from Yuval Peres at PCMI 2007.  However it comes from work of Mikhail Sodin.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and norm $1$
\item a simple harmonic oscillator $[a_m, a_n] = \delta_{m, n}$
\end{itemize}
There is a way to pass between a Gaussian and harmonic oscillator that I reviwed before\footnote{There was a trick in symplectic geometry that takes one random walk and turns it into a harmonic oscillator. It could be the Distermaat-Heckman theorem.  When I wrote one thing it magically turned into the other.  This is a linear space, so it's reasonable to assume this will work in infinite dimensions.  } \\ \\
Oh, here is a free fermion:
$$ S = \frac{1}{8\pi} \int \psi \,\overline{\partial}\psi + \overline{\psi} \,\partial \overline{\psi} $$


\newpage

\noindent There is a lot to be unhappy with here.  And yet we continue.\\ \\
Section 8 of Ginsparg shows us how to put free bosons on a torus\dots
