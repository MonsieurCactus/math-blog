\maketitle

\noindent The Wiener-Ikehera Tauberian Theorem implies the Prime Number Theorem, as can be shown in various places. \\ \\ None of those discussions really explain to me:
\begin{itemize}
\item connection to divergent series
\item how we can proceed on our own
\end{itemize}
Norber Weiner's original argument is very easy to follow:
M\"{o}bius inversion is what gives the series to start:
$$ \sum_{m=1}^\infty x^m \log m = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Lambda(n) \frac{x^n}{1-x^n} $$
and then set $x = e^{-\xi}$ and $\xi \to 0$ (or $x \to 1$). \newpage

\noindent
The two limiting behaviors are rather diffrent
$$  \frac{x^n}{1 - x^n}  = \left\{  \begin{array}{rl}
1/n\epsilon & \text{ as }x \to 1 \\
\epsilon^n & \text{ as } x \to 0 \end{array}\right. $$
and the cuttoff point is when $(1 - \epsilon)^n$ is getting small (near $n = 1/\epsilon$)
$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Lambda(n) \frac{\xi e^{-n\xi}}{1-e^{-n\xi}} \approx \sum_{n=1}^{1/\xi} \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n} $$
Maybe if we take the derivative of both sides:
$$  \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Lambda(n) \; \frac{d}{d(n\xi)}\bigg[ \frac{n\xi }{1-e^{n\xi}} \bigg]  \approx \sum_{n=1}^{1/\xi} \Lambda(n) $$
 And clearly the two sides are approximate so we are done.
$$ \frac{d}{du} \left( \frac{u}{1 - e^u} \right) = \left\{  \begin{array}{cl}
1 & \text{ as }u \to 0 \\
ue^{-u} & \text{ as } u \to \infty \end{array}\right. $$
The left side can be shown to be 1 through ``elementary" arguments. 
$$  \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Lambda(n) \; \frac{d}{d(n\xi)}\bigg[ \frac{n\xi }{1-e^{n\xi}} \bigg] \approx \frac{1}{\xi} + O(\log \xi)$$

\noindent The argument in the previous section is wrong.\footnote{I got really good at writing glib and suggestive proofs to hand in to graders.  Who themselves are not always sure so they give you a check.
$$ \sum^{1/\xi}_{n=1} a_n \, g( n \epsilon) \approx \sum^{1/\xi}_{n=1} a_n g(0) $$
Glib arguments can be acceptable, since we don't always have the time / resources to check all the cases.}  \\ \\It is very difficult to express in a vivid way - with images - why it is incorrect.  \\ \\
And in most situations it doesn't really matter. As for motivation, I can only speak for myself. \\
\begin{itemize}
\item why is Prime Number Theorem in a book on Laplace Transforms?
\item why is Prime Number Theorem in a book in Divergent Series? \\
\end{itemize}
These lead me to neo-classical approaches - they will feel pretty modern to you!\footnote{I tried to read the most modern papers first: there is Tao and Gowers and Green.  However, that conversation pre-supposes knowledge I don't have and is written in language that I really don't like.  They are pretty dreadful to read as are most papers in Analytic Number Theory as well as the people who write them!y  The ``beauty of the primes" is just a marketing term.} \\ \\
One possibility is: \textbf{there is nothing new under the sun}.  Everything is thinly dressed-up versions of the same problems since antiquity.
\newpage

\noindent And that's pretty much how we feel.  So let's try take some examples from \texttt{hep-th} and \texttt{math-nt}. \\ \\
Hopefully, also finish a real proof of PNT.\footnote{The terms ``combinatorial" or ``geometric" or ``algebraic" or ``elementary" have all been misleading and so I have often chosen to start from scratch.}  What could possibly go wrong with approximations like this? 
$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Lambda(n) \frac{\xi e^{-n\xi}}{1-e^{-n\xi}} \approx \sum_{n=1}^{1/\xi} \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n} $$
Maybe if we take the derivative of both sides:
$$  \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Lambda(n) \; \frac{d}{d(n\xi)}\bigg[ \frac{n\xi }{1-e^{n\xi}} \bigg]  \approx \sum_{n=1}^{1/\xi} \Lambda(n) $$
These should be satisfactory in any Physics or Engineering textbook. 

\newpage 

\noindent By default plotting the van Mandolt function uses \textbf{linear interpolation} - disastrous.

\noindent If we use ``dots" we get that $\Lambda(n)$ has two parts $\Lambda(n) = 0$ when $n \neq p^k$ a prime power, and also $\Lambda(n) = \log p$ when $n = p^k$.  Mysterious\footnote{It is related to $\zeta'(s)/\zeta(s)= \sum \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}$.}\\
\includegraphics{vanmangoldt-02.png} 

\newpage

\noindent The cumulative sum\footnote{basically adding all the numbers.  Please observe that $e^{\sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n)} = \mathrm{lcm}(1,2,\dot, n) \approx e^x$. This is another way of stating PNT.  The Least Common Multiple and the Permutation Group should play a more central role! } $\sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n) \approx x$ we get almost a straight line. For comparison $y=x$.

\includegraphics{vanmangoldt-03.png}  

\noindent The blue curve was consistently above the line in our range.  This bias in an artifact of our choice primes $1 < p < 10^3$

\includegraphics{vanmangoldt-04.png}  

\newpage

\noindent These pictures what the statement of PNT could mean:
$$ \sum_{n \leq x} \Lambda(n) \approx x + o(x)$$
Sometimes when reading a complicated passage I'd get cynical:\footnote{My latest idea is that Prime Number Theorem summarizes experiences with prime numbers up to a certain level.  If you're not a cryptographer, it is possible that prime number theory or the zeta function plays an implicit level.}
\begin{itemize}
\item why prime numbers?
\item where do we consider averages over primes?
\item why does it get so difficult? 
\end{itemize}
The tools and arguments get increasingly sophicistated, but many things are complicted:
\begin{itemize}
\item a chair
\item an iPhone
\item an airplane
\item rice
\end{itemize}
All these things have an intrinsic complexity.  \\ \\
Why did it take Norbert Wiener to solve this?  B/c there is signal processing and random processes all over the place.\footnote{Primes are not random, but signal processing (music) is full of signals and noise which are hard to separate.  And many of those basic tools are taught to \textit{their} undergraduates.}
