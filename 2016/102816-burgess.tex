\maketitle

\noindent Analytic number theory is not my expertise.  Here we work out some softball examples related to quadratic reciprocity. \\ \\
Here's a question: \textbf{Can permutations be used to prove Artin reciprocity} or even parts of Class Field Theory? \\ \\
The proof of quadratic reciprocity seems like a random hodge-podge of techniques.\footnote{This is great for a first class when I was 15 years old it is not so great when you in graduate school are trying to learn Class Field Theory.} Can we unify some of these arguments using:
\begin{itemize}
\item Geometry of Numbers
\item Pigeonhole Principle
\end{itemize}
Gauss in his \textit{Disquiciones Arithmeticae} uses Pigeonhole to prove that $a^p \equiv 0 \mod p$. 

\newpage 

\noindent Any other applications? \\

Quadratic Reciprocity is stated in the number theory of textbook by \textbf{Hardy + Wright} in a Chapter called 
\begin{center} {\color{green!80!white}Fermat's Theorem and its Consequences}\end{center} \textit{after} his discussion of other more advanced topics
\begin{itemize}
\item prime numbers
\item Farey fractions
\item irrational numbers
\item congruences
\end{itemize}
I dislike prime number theory.  Papers in that subject are quite tedious to read.\\ 
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0)--(19,0);
\end{tikzpicture} \\
\\
Fermat's little theorem says, e.g. $27| 3^{27}-1$:
$$ a^p = a \mod p$$
a theorem that I really like is that $5 = 2^2 + 1^2$:
$$ p = a^2 + b^2 \iff p = 4k+1 $$

\newpage

\newpage  

\noindent For proof of Quadratic Reciprocity I always refer to
\begin{itemize}
\item John Conway, \textbf{The Sensual Quadratic Form}
\end{itemize}
and he will use a proof by Zolotarev, involving the permutation group. \\ \\
So let's get started.
