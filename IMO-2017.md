International Mathematical Olympiad

12 - 23 July 2017 ---- Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

https://www.imo2017.org.br/

I could never get good at contests.  My teachers all felt
these contests require innate speed and talent (which they do)
but why not solve them as a group.  My high school math team
was not prepared for such discussions.  Mostly they focused on AMC
and ARML.

I'm am now too old 32.  And have a Master's degree.  And the scope of 
math has vastly widened.  Here is to post some notes about the most
recent IMO in Brazil, as the insights arrive.
