International Mathematical Olympiad

12 - 23 July 2017 ---- Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

https://www.imo2017.org.br/

I could never get good at contests.  My teachers all felt
these contests require innate speed and talent (which they do)
but why not solve them as a group.  My high school math team
was not prepared for such discussions.  Mostly they focused on AMC
and ARML.

I'm am now too old 32.  And have a Master's degree.  And the scope of 
math has vastly widened.  Here is to post some notes about the most
recent IMO in Brazil, as the insights arrive.

Day 1

**Q1**

* (possibly) This map only does to things.  It adds +3 to a number
and then it takes square roots as soon as it gets the chance.  
This is a dynamical system over real numbers, but I don't think there is
any chance of cycle unless over integers.  We'd have to prove that for 7 points.  And solve for **A**.

**Q2**

* pass

**Q3**

* pigeon-hole?

Day 2

**Q4**

**Q5**

**Q6**

* [IMO 2017/6 via arithmetic geometry](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/277253/imo-2017-6-via-arithmetic-geometry)
